R shiny apps

This is to explain what this repository is meant to be doing. The data used is the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). This project was created with the collaboration of the Q-Step of Glasgow University and myself. The aim of the project is to facilitate the visualization of this index and its measures to students with little to no-knowledge of coding or statistis. As a result, this project was able to allow students to get a sense of statistics, the relationships and patterns that emerge in the data and how to interpret these. 

This is the basic code for a simple R Shiny app that using all postcodes around Scotland it ranks the different measures of deprivation from the SIMD. It also plots thems into scatterplots and barcharts.
